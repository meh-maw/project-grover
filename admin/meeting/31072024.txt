Discussion
Met with Mr. Sui Jackson at the school of Arts.
Was introduced to the Geoglyph Rover.
Mr. Sui introduced the rover to us and the team.
Our major task will be to draw outdoor in a large scale. The expectation is to cover the whole campus but working over the oval for now will do.
Line Marking machine has been ordered from China and is with Mr. Sui and he will bring it to the campus soon.
The task will be to work on the line marking machine and get it motorized, where the motor isn’t available.
Viswadeep will be collecting the “…..” from Mr. Sui tomorrow at 4pm.
We are all supposed to work on the mission planner software, and everyone is asked to have it installed.
We have stocks availability in lidar sensors, raspberry pie and Arduinos, but no motors.
Insufficient funds and any order will take at least 1-2 weeks.
We have made a team’s group adding all the members and Mr. Sui in it, to have our conversation though it.
