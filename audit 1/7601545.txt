Team Communication Review
While our team generally communicates effectively through frequent in-person meetings, there is room for improvement in clarity and conciseness. The use of excessive jargon during discussions often leads to confusion among team members, including myself. To address this, we should aim to simplify our language and ensure that any new terms are clearly explained to everyone.
Establishing a consistent schedule for updates is crucial, as our current sporadic updates lead to confusion and misalignment. This issue may be partly due to the unfinished project storage system. Finalizing this system will help streamline our communications and ensure that everyone is on the same page. Implementing regular, scheduled updates—perhaps weekly or bi-weekly—would greatly enhance our cohesion and efficiency.
Our weekly meetings with stakeholder Sui have positively impacted our communication with stakeholders. However, it’s essential to include Rennei in these discussions to ensure all key stakeholders are aligned and informed. This inclusion will help prevent any miscommunication or misalignment of expectations.
One major area needing improvement is the implementation of a structured feedback mechanism. Currently, our project and team lack a formal process for providing and receiving feedback, especially concerning the repository. Establishing regular review sessions where feedback can be openly discussed and action items identified would be beneficial. This will enable us to address issues promptly and improve our overall workflow.
Additionally, when trying to understand the stages each member of the project team is at with their deliverables, responses sometimes take a while to be received. Personally, I would prefer to use only Teams as the main channel of communication. Receiving information on social media platforms such as WhatsApp, which I do not frequently use, can be messy and leads to missed responses to issues or questions discussed in meetings.

Team Project Output Review
I  understand that project deliverables are currently behind schedule due to constraints resulting from the lack of storage space on university grounds. While I am in the process of acquiring space in the macro labs and the necessary tools for both Team A and Team B (responsible for the rover and the line marking machine respectively), there are other areas we need to address to improve our workflow and outputs.
Firstly, the documentation on the repository is insufficient for the work completed so far. This documentation would benefit from better organization and a structured feedback system. Ensuring documents have clear headings, sections, and a logical flow will make them more accessible and useful to everyone involved.
Another challenge has been ensuring proper version control. Since not many of us are familiar with GitHub, we need to invest time in learning how to use it effectively. By initially uploading documents and then collaboratively working on them, we can better track changes and ensure everyone is aware of what has been added or removed. This approach will also facilitate more rigorous quality control processes through peer reviews and testing phases.
Despite the delays caused by storage space constraints, establishing clearer milestones can help align the team's efforts and keep everyone on the same page. This was partially addressed during our second meeting at Toad Hall, but we need to consistently follow through on these milestones to maintain progress.
Finally, the visual presentation of documents can be significantly enhanced. Using visual aids such as charts, graphs, and diagrams to illustrate complex concepts and data—particularly regarding the communication between the ground station and the rover—will make our documents more comprehensible and impactful.

Shadow Team Communication Review
The team’s communication strategy is well-rounded, utilizing WhatsApp and Microsoft Teams for swift, real-time exchanges, complemented by weekly in-person meetings for deeper discussions and strategic alignment. This approach effectively keeps everyone informed and engaged, promoting collaboration and team cohesion. However, managing communication across multiple platforms can sometimes lead to fragmentation or missed messages, so ensuring that key information is consistently summarized and documented would be beneficial.
Email communication with the host company on a weekly basis is appropriate for maintaining a formal, documented line of communication. However, the frequency might need to be adjusted based on the project’s phase, with more frequent updates during critical periods and less frequent communication during quieter times, to ensure alignment and responsiveness.
One significant concern is the lack of a clear conflict resolution strategy, especially given the team’s even membership. This could lead to split decisions and unresolved issues that may cause friction among team members. While meetings are currently the primary method for addressing conflicts, the absence of a defined process for handling disagreements could result in challenges later on. Introducing additional conflict resolution mechanisms, such as tie-breaking procedures, anonymous feedback tools, or designated mediators, would help mitigate potential conflicts and ensure smoother decision-making within the team.
Shadow Team Project Output Review
The project's output shows a mixed level of progress. On the positive side, there has been substantial advancement in the needs and analysis list within the Concept of Operations, demonstrating a strong understanding of the project's requirements and objectives. This progress is commendable and provides a solid foundation for the project's future stages.
However, there are some concerns regarding other aspects of the project. Notably, there has been little to no significant work done on the investment hub, as evidenced by the current state of the landing page and repository. This is a critical component of the project, and its development should be prioritized moving forward.
Additionally, it appears that work on design concepts has been limited to discussions, with no tangible outputs or draft proposals being produced. While discussions are important, it is crucial to see these ideas translated into actionable drafts, even if they are eventually revised or rejected. Draft proposals would not only provide a clearer direction but also offer a basis for constructive feedback and iterative improvement. Moving forward, I would like to see concrete drafts or mockups for the design concepts, as this will be essential for making informed decisions and driving the project towards successful completion.
